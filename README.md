# Madlibs
"Mad Libs" are short stories with placeholders that must be filled in. Without knowing the overarching tale, one person asks a second person to fill in each of the placeholders in the non-computerized version of this game. After all of the placeholders have been filled in, the second person is given the finished story, which usually has a funny ending.
The application prompts the user for input and output file names while building a new mad lib. The computer then examines the input file and prompts the user to fill in any missing information without revealing the rest of the story. The application copies the resultant text to the output file as the user fills in each placeholder. The user can then either view or exit the mad lib that was built.
